        - document in data gathering (4)
        - add to correlation matrix (4)
        - add to data exploration (4)
        - add to feature engineering (4)

- pv:
    - code:
        - add variable, that there are no break down events in summer (2)           done
        - validate and change index to fit validation (2)                           done?
        - see how break down events correlate with categroies (2)                   done
    - docu:
        - source and reason break down events (3)
        - get break down event dates and document them (4)
        - set validity of index and method (4)
        - document effect of index (4)
        - deinfe further steps (5)

- create ml models:
    - code:
        - create models (3,4,5,6)
        - see feature importance of indexes (3,4,5,6)
        - compare for different lead times (t1 and t2), (3,4,5,6)
        - see which performs the best (3,4,5,6)
    - docu:
        - create docu about models (4)
        - document featreu importance (4)
        - compare models (4)
        - decide on best model (4,5)
